# About

Terraform is an excellent tool for deploying infrastructure-as-code.
However, keeping terraform DRY, automating deployment through gitflow and ci tools,
and doing it all without leaking secrets takes a bit of extra tooling.
With [our docker image](https://github.com/orgs/taosmountain/packages/container/package/atlantis-found) and by adopting [terragrunt],
you get all of the above with minimal overhead. Also see [why use terragrunt].

## The tool stack

- **[terragrunt]** is a terraform wrapper that helps keep code DRY, maintainable, and safe to automate. See [why use terragrunt].
- **[atlantis]** is a terraform ci/cd tool that makes automating terraform via good git practices easy. No need for jenkins and you can deploy it anywhere.
- **[tfmask]** keeps ci/cd of terraform secure by filtering passwords and secrets in terraform output from plans and applies.
- **[atlantis-found]** custom atlantis image with bash wrappers for everything above and some enhancements:
  - sets opinionated atlantis config defaults so you don't need atlantis config in your tf repo.
  - removes the notoriously verbose terragrunt output from the plan.
  - ensures proper exit code for atlantis to update GitHub build status.

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- Infra to run `atlantis-found` container
- Git host like GitHub that supports PR webhooks that has http access to your deployed `atlantis-found` container.

## Usage

Follow instructions for [atlantis] but use this image. See [packages] in this repo for available image tags.

<!-- TODO: add latest stable package or example here -->

# Compatibility

While atlantis supports any terraform version at runtime,
this image uses explicit terraform and terragrunt versions
to ensure the wrappers that provide secure and terse output are compatible.

<!-- TODO: list supported tf and tg versions or link to them -->

# Contributing

Please follow our [contributing guidelines].

Use `make update` to update the CHANGELOG and README toc

## Developing

### Requirements

- docker
- make (for build/test/deploy shortcuts)

## Building

Running `make build` will build the docker image and use git tag information to tag the image.

## Testing

There are simple make tasks that ensure terraform and terragrunt are properly installed
on in the image. More testing is welcome.

```
# See Makefile for all tasks. This will build and run all current tests:

make test-all
```

## Publishing

Run `make publish` to build and publish an image based on git tag.
If forking this repo, you'll want to customize the `Makefile` to deploy to your registry.
